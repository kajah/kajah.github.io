    <p>Dear Katharine in Jan 2021:</p>
    <p>You're coming out of a year of isolation, shallow relationships, crippling concussion headaches, and heading into a year of unemployment, uncertainty, but also hope. You desperately need a community to heal you and I'm happy to share that you will find a group of people who truly care and are all-around amazing, talented, interesting, and genuine. They probably aren't aware, but you grow to be deeply thankful for their embrace. And slowly, you learn to accept parts of yourself, who you want to spend your time with, and what you truly value. Don't be skeptical of the creaky floors in the old Victorian, and those ugly seafoam green walls will grow on you.</p>
    <p>So that company you started a month ago? You'll spend hours+ in your co-founder's super cold apartment as a makeshift office, wondering if his space heater is toxic. You'll try doing a social experiment on Clubhouse (it's dead now) and manage people for the first time. The company will launch in April in conjunction with a pre-seed. You will give $30,000 to up and coming small business owners and learn how shitty Facebook ads are.</p>
    <p>Before you get too excited, I have to break it to you - you decide to shut down WizForm on your birthday in June. But this pivot decision turns out to have a silver lining - you sell the WizForm product in August to Clearco. You learn so much and make so many mistakes - I'm already feeling like a second-time founder! Startup life is not easy to say the least, but we're back on our feet and ready for 2022.</p>
    <p>Halfway through the year, you pack up everything and move to New York City. Why? Good question. You have a short stint in Boston in August and arrive in Brooklyn feeling ungrounded. Everyone in NYC is busy, and constantly taking new steps. You question if you're falling into the trap of forging shallow relationships again. You question your company and your own skills and abilities. You question what you value, your priorities, your goals. These questions are still in flight, but you make peace with this and accept that life is an ongoing gray zone, and the questions allow you to become a better version of yourself and live life fully.</p>
    <p>You meet someone in NYC who you feel an instant connection and the friendship blossoms. It makes you incredibly happy, to reforge intimate friendships that you have so long craved for, finally found in San Francisco, but lost again when you moved.</p>
    <p>During the last month of the year, you recognize that depression does not have to be severe. It can manifest as the inability to get excited to work on your own company in the morning, and the slug you have to crawl through to get to the office. It can manifest as the inability to stop scrolling through IG Reels, even though you know you care deeply about other tasks. You gain some sort of relief by recognizing this, and are determined to break from the normalization of such behavior in your mind.</p>
    <p>Finally, you approach 2022 with optimism and also apprehension. Even as I write this letter, I don't feel overly hopeful, but I also don't feel dread. I'm at peace with many things, even as chaotic and disjointed this year was. I hope you give yourself a little slack in the upcoming months, and really immerse youself in learning. I will do the same - in 2022, I'd like to allow myself to reflect & move on vs. avoid, and ground myself in my beliefs and learnings.</p>
    <p>To give thanks to all the people who have made 2021 what it was, in the next 12 days until Jan 1, 2022, I will write a letter a day, to someone who has tremendously influenced me this past year, whether they realize or not.</p>
    <p>Good luck Katharine, see you soon :)</p>
