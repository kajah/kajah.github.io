			<p style="font-weight: 700;">University of California, Berkeley</p>
			<p>Class of 2018 (December)</p>
			<p>BA in Computer Science</p>
			<p>Throughout my 3.5 years at Berkeley I've had the opportunity to join amazing student organizations. Some quick highlights below! <span style="font-weight: 700;">Go Bears!!</span></p>

			<p style="font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://berkeleytime.com/landing" target="_blank">BerkeleyTime</a></p>
			<p>BerkeleyTime is a web application for student, built by students. It allows students to easily search through 12000+ courses in the Berkeley catalog using different filters. Class enrollment is often a stressful time so BerkeleyTime relieves some of the stress by providing enrollment history, grade distributions, prereqs, section times, and much more all in one spot.</p>
			<p>We were a team of about 12 people under the Office of the Chief Technology Officer in Berkeley's student government organization (ASUC). I joined in the beginning of my junior year as a full stack engineer while the website was going through a significant redesign and refactoring of the codebase. I helped lead the rewrite of the frontend codebase to ReactJS. I learned a lot about the fundamentals of React, and worked with very talented individuals. I'm so proud of the current team for seeing the redesign through and creating a better experience for thousands of students.</p>

			<p style="font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://innovativedesign.club/" target="_blank">Innovative Design</a></p>
			<p>Innovative Design is a creative student agency that aims to Make Berkeley Beautiful. The organization has graphic design, photography, and web design teams that take on requests from other student organizations pro bono. It also offers DeCals (Berkeley classes created and run by students) on design and photography.</p>
			<p>I spent 3 semesters in Innovative Design, each semester on a web design team. During my last semester, I joined the Officer Board and led my own web team.</p>
			<p>I owe Innovative Design for nurturing my web development skills and for opening my eyes to the world of design. Thank you for making Berkeley beautiful.</p>

			<p style="font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/mobiledevsberkeley/" target="_blank">Mobile Developers of Berkeley</a></p>
			<p>Mobile Developers of Berkeley (MDB) was the first student organization I joined at Berkeley. The organization puts members through a bootcamp where you learn how to create an app for either Android or iOS in just a couple of weeks. After the bootcamp, you are free to build your own mobile app with the goal of publishing it on the Google or Apple store. I came into this organization as a complete newbie to Android development. I learned a lot and fast and came out with Version 1.0 and 2.0 of an Android app over the course of 2 semesters. The app, called WingIt, lets users experience spontaneous adventures anywhere, anytime. It creates a trip itinerary on the go, instead of planning the entire trip beforehand.</p>
			<p>Thank you MDB for showing me the infinite possibilites I can pursue with computer science outside of schoolwork. My experience in this organization has inspired me to join other organizations and pursue my ambitions.</p>
