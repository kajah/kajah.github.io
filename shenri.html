          <p>Dear Dad,</p>
          <h2>Happy Birthday!!!</h2>
          <p>This is a special birthday and year - 牛年, your lucky year!! We are also living in a special time and I wish I could be there with you in person so that we can celebrate this year together :)</p>
          <p>Thank you for supporting my dreams, inspiring me, and teaching me so much more than business school ever would. Now I am finally working hard on my dream, and I'm so happy to be following in your footsteps and journey.</p>
          <p>I am also excited for your new journeys!! You've taught me to never stop learning, never stop dreaming. I wish you the most success.</p>
          <p>May this year bring luck, more happiness, more health, and &#128176 !!</p>
