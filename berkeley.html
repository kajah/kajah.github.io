                <p>BerkeleyTime is a web application for student, built by students. It allows students to easily search through 12000+ courses in the Berkeley catalog using different filters. Class enrollment is often a stressful time so BerkeleyTime relieves some of the stress by providing enrollment history, grade distributions, prereqs, section times, and much more all in one spot.</p>

                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>BerkeleyTime is a team of about 12 people under the Office of the Chief Technology Officer in Berkeley's student government organization (ASUC). I joined in the beginning of my junior year as a full stack engineer while the website was going through a significant redesign and refactoring of the codebase. I helped lead the rewrite of the frontend codebase to ReactJS. I learned a lot about the fundamentals of React, and worked with very talented individuals. I'm so proud of the current team for seeing the redesign through and creating a better experience for thousands of students.</p>
